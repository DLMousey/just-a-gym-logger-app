# Just a Gym Logger app

Another app in the just "Just a <thing> app" series, this time looking at the weird and wonderful
world of fitness tracking. You put the gyms in you train at, you put your sessions in and some basic 
reporting (todo) will tell you how you're doing.

No ads, no data harvesting, just a hefty Room database layer accessing SQLite on your device.

Written in Kotlin attempting to follow current best practice wherever possible
