# Just a Gym Logger app

If you're fed up of carting around a pen and paper at the gym this app's shooting to be a perfect
replacement providing insight, (eventually) providing insight into your progress and helping
you target areas for improvement.

Another app in the just "Just a <thing> app" series, this time looking at the weird and wonderful
world of fitness tracking. You put the gyms in you train at, you put your sessions in and some basic 
reporting (todo) will tell you how you're doing.

No ads, no data harvesting, just a hefty Room database layer accessing SQLite on your device.

Written in Kotlin attempting to follow current best practice wherever possible
